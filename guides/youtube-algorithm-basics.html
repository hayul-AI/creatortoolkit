            <h1>YouTube Algorithm Basics: How Recommendations Work</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-muted);">Published on February 01, 2026</p>
            
            <p>The YouTube algorithm isn't a mysterious force; it's a recommendation system with one goal: keep viewers on the platform. It doesn't care about your subscriber count—it cares about the viewer's history.</p>

            <h2>Three Main Discovery Surfaces</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> The most valuable real estate. Videos here are personalized based on watch history.</li>
                <li><strong>Suggested Videos:</strong> The sidebar on desktop or below the player on mobile. These videos are contextually related to what you're currently watching.</li>
                <li><strong>Search:</strong> Where users actively look for answers. This is the easiest place for new channels to start.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The "Satisfaction" Signal</h2>
            <p>In 2026, YouTube focuses heavily on viewer satisfaction. This is measured by likes, "Not Interested" clicks, and surveys. High watch time isn't enough if users leave feeling frustrated or clickbaited.</p>

            <h2>How to Trigger the Algorithm</h2>
            <p>You can't "hack" the algorithm, but you can feed it good data. Upload consistently, keep people watching (retention), and get them to click (CTR). When these metrics align, the system finds more people like your current viewers and recommends your video to them.</p>
